I'm elvis (he/him/his)

I work at [Warp](https://warp.dev/), where we are building a Rust-based GPU-accelerated modern terminal!
Our mission is to [elevate developer productivity.](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/discussions?discussions_q=label%3ARoadmap+sort%3Atop)

Prior to this I did research at Emory University, Pomona College, and interned at Facebook Inc.

I'm interested in developer advocacy, community building, equity in technology, and computer science education.
I love well written documentation and play full-back (right back).

I'm fortunate that we're [remote-first at Warp.](https://www.warp.dev/hiring)
Atlanta, GA is my homebase.

Barca over Madrid
