I went to [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/), chirp chirp!

I work at [Warp](https://warp.dev/), where we are building a Rust-based GPU-accelerated modern terminal!
Our mission is to [elevate developer productivity.](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/discussions?discussions_q=label%3ARoadmap+sort%3Atop)
Join our [Discord!](https://discord.gg/warpdotdev) I'm fortunate that we're [remote first at Warp](https://rigorous-worm-62d.notion.site/Public-Warp-How-We-Work-b872d41a1da743fca18220a731aeba48) and live in Atlanta, GA. Go ATL UTD!!! Go Braves!! Go Hawks! Our other team I will not speak of.

I love well written documentation! (check out [swimm](https://swimm.io))
